# 👁️ The Awakening Index (AIx)
### Quantifying the Perception of the Imaginary Axis

> **"What gets measured, gets managed. Even the soul."**

## 1. Overview
In **Love-OS**, "Awakening" is defined as the **OS update from 1D (Real Axis only) to 2D (Complex Plane).**
A refined consciousness does not just see visible results ($x$); it perceives the invisible accumulation of Intent and Virtue ($y$).

The **Awakening Index (AIx)** is a composite metric $[0, 1]$ that quantifies how well a user can **sense, integrate, and utilize the Imaginary Axis.**

## 2. The 5 Components of Awakening ($C_1 - C_5$)

We decompose the "Imaginary Sense" into 5 observable engineering metrics.

### (C1) Coherence (Superconductivity)
**"Are your Actions aligned with your Ideal?"**
Measures the lack of resistance between the Impulse ($I$) and the Action ($A$). High coherence means low energy loss.
$$C_1 = 1 - \frac{\int |I(t) - A(t)| dt}{\int (|I(t)| + |A(t)|) dt + \varepsilon}$$

### (C2) Area Sensitivity (Prophetic Sense)
**"Can you feel the weight of the invisible?"**
Measures the correlation between the user's subjective confidence ($q$) and the mathematically accumulated Love Area ($\mathcal{A}$). A high score means you can *feel* a Phase Transition coming before it manifests in reality.
$$C_2 = \text{corr}(q(t), \mathcal{A}_{\Delta}(t))^+$$

### (C3) Phase Sensitivity (Slip Detection)
**"Can you detect the shift?"**
The ability to detect a **Phase Slip** (Dimensional Jump) exactly when it happens.
$$C_3 = \text{Normalized Accuracy of Event Detection}$$

### (C4) Boundary Control (Thermal Efficiency)
**"Can you open/close without burning out?"**
The ability to modulate Resistance ($R$) smoothly. High scores indicate managing boundaries with minimal Joule heating (Shame/Friction).
$$C_4 = 1 - \sigma\left( \int (I-A)^2 R \, dt \right)$$

### (C5) Synchronization (Field Generation)
**"Can you align the field without force?"**
The ability to generate a high Order Parameter ($r$) in a group without using coercion.
$$C_5 = \sigma(\bar{r}) \quad \text{where} \quad r e^{i\psi} = \frac{1}{N}\sum e^{i\theta_j}$$

## 3. The Formula

The Total Awakening Index is the weighted sum of these components, learned via Factor Analysis to correlate with long-term well-being and impact.

$$\boxed{ \text{AIx} = \sum_{k=1}^{5} w_k C_k \quad \in [0, 1] }$$

* **AIx = 0.0:** Sleep Mode. Driven only by visible stimuli (Real Axis).
* **AIx = 1.0:** Awakened Mode. Fully operating on the Complex Plane.

## 4. Self-Diagnostic Checklist (Subjective Proxy)
If biometric data is unavailable, use these subjective proxies to estimate your $C_k$.

| Component | Symptom of High Score |
| :--- | :--- |
| **C1** | You act on intuition immediately without overthinking. |
| **C2** | You feel a "heavy silence" or "certainty" before a visible result appears. |
| **C3** | You can sense when the "vibe" of a room shifts instantly. |
| **C4** | You can open up or set boundaries without feeling guilt or heat. |
| **C5** | People naturally calm down and sync up when you enter the room. |
